## 4 mock live coding interviews in 44 hours

The problem: I will have a live pair coding interview in 44 hours. I've never done any live coding. 

Solution: I did 4 mock interviews and then did well in the real interview. 

Details: I googled "mock live coding interview" and used the results, including a [reddit thread/ (https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1crvwwi/platforms_where_you_can_take_live_mock_coding/). 

Here are my 4 interviews in the sequence they occurred in. My interview was in React/TypeScript for a small startup, no FAANG. The company specified that they would send me a zip file that I will have to open in my IDE and proceed per their instructions. 

1. Fiverr. Saw this promotion in Google search: "I will do a mock coding interview with you as a google engineer." I did not really need a googler; I searched and found someone else that had the needed skills and was available next morning. (The specific person I found was [Ritesh Kumar](
https://fiverr.com/s/6QDPXr), he did an exccellent job.) 

The mock interview itself: I was fumbling with my setup: how to present the IDE, the browser, the dev tools... I forgot to ask clarifying questions and forgot to coordinate with the interviewer several solutions... Ritesh helped me get through it. The price was very reasonable, at least if you are in the USA. 

2. Matt at https://coachmatt.io/. Found him through the above Reddit thread and he was kind enough to be available next afternoon. This was somewhat pricey but cheaper than interviewing.io. 

Matt gave me a scenario that was very close to the planned interview. I did less fumbling with the setup and did better with clarifying questions. I felt more confident. 

3. A personal connection. Found him through a mutual friend. He gave me a somewhat difficult problem that he used to use when interviewing for his company. It involved a JS feature I had only scarecedly used and did not remember the syntax of... so I did not feel I did a great job. Well, so I saw a blank spot I had to remedy (and did immediately afterwards). Yet I was able to practice communicating with the interveiwer and asking questions/following directions. 

The above 3 interviews occurred in 1 day. 

4. https://adplist.org/ is a platform where you can get mentorship for free. I was surprised with it being free, but found no strings attached. (Thank you to @Anna Miller who introduced me to it.) It gives you an option to search for "Available ASAP", which was vital in my case. Now the downside of the platform: you can search by name, company, role. You cannot search for a specific technology. For example, if nobody included "C#" in their role, you would not find any C# engineers through a search. You would have to look through a list of engineers and their individual skills... I was fortunate that React is a common tool. I easily found [Oluwafemi Sosanya](https://adplist.org/mentors/oluwafemi-sosanya), a senior React Developer, who was available on sort notice. 

Oluwafemi ended up spending with me 2 hours instead of 1 as originally scheduled. He ran me through many things, up through complex React features, some of those I'd never used in practice (my primary framework being Vue.js). But he was very kind and made it very easy for me and I felt very comfortable with React. 

Then I took a break and walked into a real interview an hour later :) 

I wasn't entirely calm, but I certainly didn't fumble with the IDE or the setup, I did not fumble with the basics of React, I stayed in communication with the interviewer. None of this would've been possible if I hadn't practiced beforehand. 

Note on some other things I've explored: 

Interviewing.io: seems like a good platform, but it is pricey and geared toward FAANG. 
Pramp: covered in [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/172fiwt/mock_interview_practice), seems workable but not immediate so was out of my timeline.
