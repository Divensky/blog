нужно самому делать ошибки, чтобы мозг сделал квантовый скачок. 
Использовать такие принципы:
- просить ИИ объяснять, а не просто давать готовый код
- если получил код от ИИ - переписывать ручками, без CTRL+C, чтобы хотя бы моторику нарабатывать
- спрашивать ИИ только после того, как сам продумал возможный вариант решения (ну или если вообще никаких идей нет, но хотя бы подумал) 
- перепроверять ответы ИИ на важные вопросы через гугл-поиск и/или другой ИИ (у меня пара chatGPI + phind.com)
- спрашивать ИИ о best practices при решении задач.  

Inspiration for the above was the video: https://youtu.be/eGFH8Jhb2Nk?si=cDgSFp0TUxg2oXoK

Also: 
- Don't ask a more senior dev before you've made SURE that AI cannot answer this Q. 

Using AI While Learning to Code

Can AI write code for you? Sure! Can it think for you? Well...

Pros of using AI to code for you: 

* Faster, short-term 
* It often incorporates best practices

Pros of using AI: 

* Copy-paste does not give you learning experience
* Slower, long-term: you ask AI again and again about the same thing

Here are the principles that I deduced: 

Knowledge is CERTAINTY. When you're certain of something, you know it. Every time you have spent some time learning to code or practicing coding, you want walk out being CERTAIN of at least one more thing.

When you get up after having spent some time coding or learning to code, ask yourself: what I am now CERTAIN of or MORE CERTAIN of? Did I learn a concept or principle that I am now certain of? Or did I become certain in how to accomplish something in my code? If you did - cheers! Cherish this certainty. 

Try to add one certainty per a period of doing. You will see your certainties building up. 

* Don't ask AI to give you the code. Ask it to explain. 
* Identify what you're missing to execute the coding task at hand. Ask AI to help you fill in that missing piece - not code. 
* Never cut-and-paste. If AI gave you some code and you decided to use it, TYPE it all. You know why? Your fingers learn to think, too :) Kidding. As you're typing, it's your chance to spot things you don't really know. And you get used to executing concepts in code. 
* Before you ask a Q of an AI, ask yourself: how would I do it? Write down your draft. Then ask AI and compare it to your draft. Maybe it confirms you were right. Maybe it helps you learn the applicable best practices.
* Before you ask a Q of a senior dev, ask it of AI. 
* Use "regenerate" button liberaly. It can help: (1) rephrase the answer so you get another take on it; (2) spot an erroneous first answer. Then the 2nd and subsequent answers recommend something else than the first, beware. Likely there is no correct way or AI does not know it. 
* To get relevant answers, specify your language/framework in your Qs to AI. 

[“It's better to ask a stupid question than to make a stupid assumption.”](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/11681730-it-s-better-to-ask-a-stupid-question-than-to-make)
Or 
"It's better to ask a studpid question than to make a stupid mistake." Now you can ask any number of stupid questions with impunity: ask them of AI.
